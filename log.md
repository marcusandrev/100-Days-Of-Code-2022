### Day 1: July 17, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: <br/>
- *Self Learning:* Day 1/21 Challenge of Conquering Responsive Layouts by Kevin Powell 
- *Project:* Created themes and installed styled components for Foodify project

**Thoughts** <br/>
- *Self Learning:* Learned that CSS is Responsive by default. You did something to make it not responsive.
- *Project:* Storybook is kinda iffy at first when you did it but realized you haven't installed styled components yet

**Some Notes**
1. For responsive layouts, use percentages. Using Pixels make it use several media queries
	- By default, CSS are responsive (width of 100%)

2. **Don't use heights;** only widths
	- When screen is small, the text will be overflowed
