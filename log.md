## Day 20: September 6

**Today's Progress**: <br/>

- **Topic/s:** Next.js
- **Self Learning:** Learned more about Server Side Generation and understanding it's use case. Also, got a eureka moment on data fetching in Next.JS. Basically, Static and Server-side rendering (both are pre-rendering) pre-rendering the html in advance, which improves performance and SEO since the html meta data are read. Both has their cons but Ill more to Server Side rendering since data are fetched at request time--immediate updating of data when browser is refreshed.
